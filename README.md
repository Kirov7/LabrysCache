Based on the theoretical realization of this paper [《TinyLFU: A Highly E cient Cache Admission Policy》]([[1512.00727\] TinyLFU: A Highly Efficient Cache Admission Policy (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00727))

> In addition, the powerful caffeine cache in the java ecosystem is also based on this paper
